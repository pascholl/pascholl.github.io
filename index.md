## Biography

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Cryptography Group at Aarhus University.
My research interests are multi-party computation (MPC), particularly constructing
more efficient protocols with improved security properties, as well as
implementation and applications of MPC.

In November 2015 I completed by PhD, titled *Design and Implementation of Secure Multi-Party Computation*, supervised by [Nigel Smart](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~nigel/).
