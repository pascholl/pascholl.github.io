I'm an Associate Professor in the [Cryptography Group](http://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup/) at Aarhus University.
My research is mainly focused on secure computation, particularly designing general-purpose protocols for multi-party computation, as well as related tools like oblivious transfer, homomorphic secret sharing and zero-knowledge proofs.

Previously, I was a postdoc in Aarhus from 2017 until July 2019. Before coming to Aarhus, I was a postdoc in the [Cryptography & Information Security Group](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/research/cryptography/) at the University of Bristol, where I also studied for my PhD and undergraduate degrees.
In November 2015 I completed by PhD, titled *Design and Implementation of Secure Multi-Party Computation*, supervised by [Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/).
