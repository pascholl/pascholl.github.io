## Biography

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cryptography Group](http://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup/) at Aarhus University.
My research is mainly focused on secure computation, particularly constructing
more efficient protocols with improved security properties, as well as
implementation and applications.

In November 2015 I completed by PhD, titled *Design and Implementation of Secure Multi-Party Computation*, supervised by [Nigel Smart](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~nigel/).
